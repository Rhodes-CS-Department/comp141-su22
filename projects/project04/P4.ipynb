    "# Project 4: Perpetual Calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "A perpetual calendar is a calendar designed to be valid for many years, usually designed to look up the day of the week for a given date in the future. In this project, you will design a perpetual calendar by writing a number of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to implement your project. There are eleven steps, but they are all relatively short, so it looks a lot more involved than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are beginning to write longer programs, we will practice dividing our programs into functions. This is a critical habit to develop, because building a program out of functions that work together enables faster software development, because functions can be tested individually, then combined together into larger functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When first thinking about a program, try to envision it as a set of components that all fit together like a puzzle, where each component handles a separate, distinct task. Consider making separate tasks into separate functions. Now this idea can be taken to the extreme, which is not helpful, as using too many functions, especially if these functions all need access to the same variables, ends up being very messy because you have to write functions that take, for instance, ten arguments. Try to find a balance between too many functions and too few.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 1:__ Recall that Python has a number of different data types, including ints, floats, and strings. In this project, we will learn about another data type, called a boolean. Boolean variables can only hold two values, either True or False. For a review on Booleans, check out the [notebook named `booleans`](booleans.ipynb) in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2:__ Review the comment guide on Canvas. Every function you write, except main(), must have a comment before it explaining what the function does, what the parameters are, and what the return value is.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 3:__ Open `pcalendar.py` and fill in the missing information in the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 4 (Determining if a year is a leap year):__ Write a function called is_leap that takes a parameter called year, which will be an integer. Your function should return True if the year is a leap year, and False if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition line of this function should look like this `def is_leap(year):`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Algorithm__:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless the year is divisible by 100, in which case the year must also be divisible by 400. In other words, the years 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 are all leap years. However, the years 1700, 1900, and 2100 are not leap years. The first set of years are all divisible by 4, and the only year that is divisible by 100 (2000) is also divisible by 400. The second set of years are all divisible by 100, but none of them are divisible by 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can test a number for divisibility by using the % operator, which returns the remainder of one number divided by another. For instance 14 % 3 is 2, because 14 divided by 3 is 4 (the quotient) with 2 left over (the remainder). A number $x$ is divisible by another number $y$ if the remainder when $x$ divided by $y$ is zero. For instance, you can test whether a variable num is divisible by 2 by writing an if statement such as if x % 2 == 0.\n",
