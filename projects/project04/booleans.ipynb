    "# Boolean Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have learned about three Python data types: ints, floats, and strings. Recall that a data type is a\n",
    "piece of information attached to a value or variable that tells the programming language how to interpret that\n",
    "variable or value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 42 # x is an integer (int) variable (b/c 42 is an integer value.)\n",
    "y = 42.7 # y is a floating-point (float) variable (because 42.7 is a floating-point value.)\n",
    "z = \"hello\" # z is a string (str) variable (b/c \"hello\" is a string value.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many other data types to represent other types of information. One important type is the Boolean\n",
    "data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two possible values for that a Boolean can be, `True` or `False`. This might seem\n",
    "strange because `int`s, `float`s, and `string`s have potentially an infinite number of possible values, but Booleans\n",
    "have only two! They are used normally used situations where you need to represent the truth of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and use Boolean variables in Python, you can just use the special Python keywords `True` and `False`\n",
    "(they must be capitalized). These are the only two values that may be stored in a Boolean variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "game_over = True # game_over is a Boolean variable holding the value True\n",
    "ac_broken = False # ac_broken is a Boolean variable holding the value False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it is very tempting to put quotes around the values True and False, however, this will create string\n",
    "variables, not Boolean variables! `\"True\"` and `\"False\"` are not the same thing as `True` and `False`!"

    "True if the user happens to win or lose. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Can it be used for other things?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean variables are also commonly used as the return value of a function that is designed to determine\n",

    "is even or odd. This can be done by dividing the number by 2 and examining the remainder. An even number, \n",
