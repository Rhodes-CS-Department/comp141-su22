We call this the neighborhood. Plant A always uses a neighborhood of 1, which means it looks at 1 neighboring plant on either side. Plant B is allowed to use a neighborhood of any integer size. For instance, a neighborhood of 2 means that every Plant B is allowed to consider itself, plus the two plants to its left and the two plants to its right to figure out what it does in the next generation.\n",
    "* Plant B's growth pattern is based off of whether or not the total number of alive plants - big or small - in the neighborhood is even or odd. Whenever the number of alive plants in the neighborhood is odd, then the plant will grow bigger (changing from dormant to small, or small to big). When the number of alive plants in the neighborhood is even, then the plant will grow smaller (changing from big to small, or small to dormant). More specifically:\n",
    "* If a plant is big, and the number of alive plants in the neighborhood is odd, then it will stay big in the next generation (since it can't grow any bigger).\n",

In other words, for a neighborhood of 1, the single far left and far right plants are always dormant (like with Plant A). For a neighborhood of 2, the two far left and far right plants are always dormant.\n",

    "Let's examine a few generations of Plant B, with a neighborhood of 1. Suppose we have a row of eight plants. We represent a big plant with a caret (^), a small plant with an asterisk (*), and a dormant plant with a period (.). Suppose the plants begin like this:\n",

    "* Plant 1 is big, and the total number of alive plants (big or small) within its neighborhood is 2 (itself, plus the small plant on the right). Because 2 is even, this plant will become small in the next generation.\n",
    "* Plant 2 is similar in that the total number of alive plants in its neighborhood is 2 (itself and the big plant to the left). Because 2 is even and this plant is already small, it will become dormant in the next generation.\n",
    "* Plant 3 has a similar neighborhood (2 alive plants). But it is already dormant, so it will stay dormant.\n",
    "* Plant 4 has a neighborhood with 1 alive plant (itself). Because 1 is odd, this plant will stay big in the next generation.\n",
    "* Plant 5 has a neighborhood with 2 alive plants. This plant is dormant, and 2 is even, so this plant will stay dormant.\n",
    "* Plant 6 has a neighborhood with 1 alive plant. This plant is small, so it will grow to big in the next generation.\n",
    "* Plant 7 is the far right plant without a full neighborhood, so it will stay dormant.\n",
