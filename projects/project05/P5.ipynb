    "The Memphis Zoo is one of only three zoos in the United States to have a giant panda exhibit (the National Zoo in Washington, DC, and Zoo Atlanta in Georgia are the others).  The pandas at the Memphis Zoo are named Ya Ya and Le Le,\n",
    "and they have lived at the zoo since 2003.  Ya Ya is originally from Beijing, China, while Le Le comes from Changquing, China.  The name \"Ya Ya\" means \"beautiful little girl,\" and \"Le Le,\" pronounced roughly \"luh luh,\" means \"happy happy.\"  According to the Zoo, \"...they [are] only the ninth pair in the world outside of China.  There are thought to be fewer than 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild, making it one of the most endangered species on the planet.\"  ([Source](https://www.memphiszoo.org/blog/posts/memphis-zoo-will-continue-to-house-giant-pandas))\n",

    "\n",
    "This game begins with a pile of stones; each time they play they choose a different starting number. The pandas take turns taking stones the pile. Each turn, a panda may take either 1, 2 or 3 stones. They must take at least one stone, and cannot take more than three stones. The panda who takes the final stone **loses** the game, and the other panda wins. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Let's assume the pile starts with 8 stones.\n",

    "* Le Le may take 1 or 2 stones (not 3 because that would exceed the number of stones in the pile), and chooses to take 1.  The pile now has 1 stone.\n",
    "* Ya Ya must now take 1 stone (2 or 3 would exceed the number in the pile), which makes 0 in the pile.  The game ends and therefore Ya Ya **loses** the game."

    "\n",
    "To help you build this program, we have broken the design into several parts. Please read through the entire project description before starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few questions will ask you to implement the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a function that checks to see if the game is over.\n",
    "* a function that updates who the current player is.\n",
    "* a function that asks the players who will make the first move.\n",
    "* a function that asks a player how many stones they want to take from the pile.\n",
    "* a full program to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four questions each ask you to write a single function. To test them, you will call them from the notebook using test values. Testing functions with known inputs and outputs is called __unit testing__. If a __unit test__ doesn't produce the correct output, you know there is a bug in the function!\n",
    "\n",
