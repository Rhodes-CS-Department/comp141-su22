    "In this program you will be creating a program that draws images from a sequence of $x$ and $y$ coordinates that will be read from an input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ Unlike previous programs, this project will require you to start your Python program from scratch. _You_ will decide what functions should be in your program, and how it should be organized. I have provided a simple start to your program, what it does next is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of program\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, your program should function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask the user for a file name to get coordinates from.\n",
    "1. Open a canvas with the dimensions given in the file.\n",
    "1. Read the in the rest of the file and parse and run the commands in the file.\n",
    "1. After all of the commands have been read and executed, display the canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The picture file format\n",
    "\n",
    "The files that you read in are regular text files, but they will have a specific format. Each line in the file will be a command that your Python code should interpret and run. These commands will specify where and how to draw lines on the canvas; the end result of executing these commands will be an image that can be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "* `canvas`: This command specifies the size of the drawing canvas that should be used and is __always__ going to be the very first line of the file and will appear only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lineto` (line to): This command should draw a line from the _current point_ to the _next point._\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dlineto` (dotted line to): This command should draw a dotted line from the _current point_ to the _next point._\n",
    "\n",
    "* `jumpto` (jump to): This command should result in the _current point_ changing to the specified point, with no line drawn between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines should be drawn with a thickness of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that you always need to open the canvas before calling many of the functions to set the color or line thickness._"

    "1. Set the current point as $(50, 90)$.\n",
    "1. Draw a line from the current point to $(90, 50)$ and set the current point as $(90, 50)$.\n",
    "1. Set the current point as $(100, 200)$.\n",
    "1. Draw a line from the current point to $(100, 250)$ and set the current point as $(100, 250)$\n",

    "## Writing your program\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `draw.py` is in the same folder as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `main()` function should:\n",
    "* Prompt the user for the name of a file to open.\n",
    "* Open the file and read the size of the canvas to open.\n",
    "* Using a loop, read and execute the commands, calling `draw_line` from the graphics library ([reference](https://matthewlang.github.io/comp141/graphics.html)) and `draw_dotted_line` (you will have to write this function).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to this project is to get this program basically working before you implement the `draw_dotted_line` function (for example, you might have a \"placeholder\" version of the function that just draws a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def draw_dotted_line(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",

    "    draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this, you can test with the cell below, and then proceed with the next section that describes the algorithm for drawing a dotted line.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Deciding where the dots go\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at the problem: we are given $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$. We want to draw a sequence of dots between them. The dots are going to be spaced apart by 10 pixels.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/141-files/dots-step2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the number of points, we can compute their positions. In order to do that, we need to know the change in x and y between the points (we'll call these x-step and y-step).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/141-files/dots-step3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first point will be at $(x1, y1)$. Then, the next point (moving from left to right) will be at $(x1 + xstep, y1 + ystep)$. The third point can be found by adding the x-step and y-step to the second point, and so on. The last point is at $(x2, y2)$.\n",

    "* Divide this distance by 10 and convert it to an integer. The resulting value is the number of gaps in the line.\n",
    "* Calculate the total change in the x and y directions.\n",
    "* Divide these by the number of gaps to get the `x_step` and `y_step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, draw the line:\n",
    "* Draw a dot at the starting point (circle of radius 2).\n",
    "* Use a loop to draw the intermediate dots between the starting point and the ending point. With each iteration of the loop, calculate the location of the next dot by adding `x_step` and `y_step` to the current x and y coordinates. Draw a circle at each point.\n",
    "* If necessary, draw the ending point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should have four parameters: `draw_dotted_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ will be the starting and ending points of the line.\n",
